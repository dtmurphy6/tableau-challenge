# tableau-challenge
Using the provided data I compared June, July, and August of 2021 and 2022. To do this I downloaed the CSV's for each month and then aggregated them together in to a single CSV. Due to size limitations I only included the aggregation code (merge_csvs.ipynb). Once that was completed I loaded my new CSV in to Tableau.

I observed general year over year increases in ridership. I also highlighted popular times and locations for riders. I included a map of existing stations and information about the fleet of bikes.
